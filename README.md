Currently, the application does not start on it's own; however, there are some steps that can be taken to get it running locally.

# How to Install

1. Clone the repository with this command: git clone https://github.com/Reactionz/MastrMind.git

2. Go within the root directory.

3. Go within the mastrmind_backend directory and use this command to download the packages needed for the backend: npm install

4. Once all packages are installed, use this command to initalize the backend: npm start

5. Once that is initiallzed, you will do the same thing with the mastrmind_frontend folder where you will back out of the mastrmind_backend folder, select the mastrmind_frontend folder then use the command within your command line: npm install

6. Once all installed, use this command to start the front-end of the application: npm start

7. You will then be directed to the home page of our application.

# TODO

1. Still need to get a domain to host our page at all times or when needed.
2. A lot.
